Welcome to Mahanthi Bukkapatnam's LeetCode world

My Motivation and Expectation for doing LeetCode

* Learn Algorithmic thought process
* I want to decode the thought process to be a master at competitive programming
* Challenge - I want to boost my own morale.
* I want some bragging rights. I want to be associated with the leetcode brand
* Help others learn to be a better programmer (There is a teacher in me)
* I am currently employed and I want to do these challenges not to get a job, just to revel in the joy of solving problems. I want to appreciate the beauty of these Data Structures and Algorithms.
* I want to apply Math concepts. I want to get good at applying the Math thought process

Here is a quote regarding walking and destination:
If you love the journey, you will walk farther than the man who loves the destination -KAWULIRA EDWIN

* My goal is to solve a lot of problems. Let me see how far I go.

Problem Solving Approach:

* Use Pen and Paper
* Understand the problem. 
* Do the brute force strategy first
* Identify Cases. List the cases on paper
* Start with Unit Tests
* Code the solution
* Analyze the complexity of the code
* Submit the solution - rinse and repeat will the solution is accepted
* Commit the code into GitHub. [This is important]
* Improvise the solution if you have the time and energy
* Take notes as to what the pattern this problem has.

How I debug:

Sometimes I do use the debugger. But mostly I try to debug by writing the relevant information to the console and thereby try to debug the problem.

There are several advantages to log information to the console and debug through that.
It is faster. I don't have to step line by line. I see the output in one go.

To enable proper logging, I have developed a set of Debugging Util classes.  

 * print an array along with the name
 * print a variable name and value.
