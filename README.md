### My Problem-Solving Approach:

* Use Pen and Paper
* Understand the problem.
* Do the brute force strategy first
* Identify Cases. List the cases on paper
* Start with Unit Tests
* Code the solution
* Analyze the complexity of the code
* Submit the solution - rinse and repeat will the solution is accepted
* Commit the code into GitHub. [This is important]
* Improvise the solution if you have the time and energy
* Take notes as to what the pattern this problem has.

Update (12/20/2024):  The above approach will need to change based on the coding platforms and for the contests.


#### My Motivation and Expectation for doing LeetCode/Competitive Programming

* Learn the Algorithmic thought process
* I want to decode the thought process to be a master at competitive programming
* Challenge - I want to boost my own morale.
* I want some bragging rights. I want to be associated with the leetcode brand
* Help others learn to be a better programmer (There is a teacher in me)
* I am currently employed and I want to do these challenges not to get a job, just to revel in the joy of solving problems. I want to appreciate the beauty of these Data Structures and Algorithms.
* I want to apply Math concepts. I want to get good at applying the Math thought process

Fine, all the above reasons sound good, what is the real purpose for doing all this?

Here is a quote regarding walking and destination:

**If you love the journey, you will walk farther than the man who loves the destination - Kawulira Edwin**

* My true motivation boils down to this: I revel in understanding complex concepts and I want to solve hard problems.

#### How I debug:

Sometimes I do use the debugger. But mostly I try to debug by writing the relevant information to the console and thereby try to debug the problem.
There are several advantages to log information to the console and debug through that.
It is faster. I don't have to step line by line. I see the output in one go.
To enable proper logging, I have developed a set of Debugging Util classes.

* print an array along with the name
* print a variable name and value.

Update (12/20/2024): I am going through the Smart Coder program by Smart Interviews and the approach to debugging needs to change. I am leaving the above as a reference to how I used to debug, and I will update the optimal way to debug for CP platforms in a few weeks.
