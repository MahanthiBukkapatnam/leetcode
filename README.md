Problem Solving Approach


How I debug:

Sometimes I do use the debugger. But mostly I try to debug by writing the relevant information to the console and thereby try to debug the problem.

There are several advantages to log information to the console and debug through that.
It is faster. I don't have to step line by line. I see the output in one go.

To enable proper logging, I have developed a set of Debugging Util classes.  

 * print an array along with the name
 * print a variable name and value.
